Prior to 2016 Democrats lived the EC because they had supposedly build an impenetrable firewall of states that made it impossible for Republicans to win. Then they lost and suddenly the EC was the Great Satan. The reality is, if you change the rules, the tactics will change as well. When conservatives in CA and NY or liberals in TX realize that their individual vote will now matter, they will come out in bigger numbers. The margins of victory in those states could very well shrink making the overall outcome less predictable. But this won’t happen anytime in the foreseeable future. Many decades at a minimum. They way politics have been driving people farther and farther apart makes the likelihood of us ever passing another constitutional amendment a near impossibility regardless of the issue.

It also had to follow up on the story of BfA, making it a one-two punch of diabolically poor plot development and storytelling, with some of the most amateurish and egregious retcons Warcraft has ever had. And let me be clear about retcons: they are not innately bad. It just so happens that Shadowlands ones were atrocious.//////Dragonflight is absolutely starting off on a much better foot than either of those expansions. BfA failed to properly learn from *Legion* by retaining infinite grind and even homogenising the Artifact system in the worst possible way; a neck piece that belongs to every single class and spec in the game and doesn't even have much visual impact. The visual impact it *does* have pays no attention to who you are, unlike Artifacts.//////Shadowlands then takes borrowed power (which is not innately bad either), switches up infinite grind with a Renown system which, in isolation, is actually *really good,* but makes the power elements tied with Covenant Choice and *not flexibly changed either.* So where you had four cool class-abilities to play around with that would have different uses, Blizzard ended up with one-of-four class-abilities to play around with that couldn't possibly be balanced against one another for all situations. So if you wanted to be good at PvP or Raiding or M+, you had to commit to one over the other.//////Oh... and did I mention Legendary acquisition? Torghast was, even in 9.0, a great addition to the game. Its only major flaw was that it was *mandatory.* Later renditions of Torghast with Phantasma-purchasable and boss-lootable transmogs made it even better. But it earned the name Choreghast because people didn't want to do two runs of it a week but they had to for Legendary-crafting resources. I never minded doing Torghast myself, even when I had 3 active characters for 6 Torghast runs a week. But Torghast was right up my alley and there were plenty of players for whom it wasn't, and there's no reason they should have had to grind Torghast.//////Dragonflight on a *fundamental level* seems to have hit all the right marks. Player power is all located in a single, highly flexible system that doesn't root you into one playstyle, spec, or avenue of end-game content. Reputations have been updated with Renown levels, a far more streamlined and rewarding experience, without those Renown levels being necessarily ""essential"" to player power either. PvP gear is nearly entirely balanced against itself, without being exceedingly powerful in PvE. Even Professions seem substantially improved with more rewarding and engaging features, offering (currently) competitive gear without being oppressive - though I suppose there's an argument to be made about Titan Matrix drops for folks who don't have crafting Professions.//////Altogether there's a lot of room for improvement but there isn't much that actually holds the game down like an anchor. While not everything is super-standout exceptional, there hasn't been anything that has stood out to me as awful either.//////Well, Tailors getting banned for Chronocloth/Azureweave production is pretty damn bad, to be fair.//////But yeah, the critical difference here is that there aren't many standout issues with the systems or designs that people have been warning about since *prior to release* that just weren't addressed.//////I can't say this applies to every single aspect of gameplay; Old Gods know that some classes/specs are feeling neglected. But if Blizzard does right by those Specs, they can be addressed with the systems that are in place. No spec is doomed to fail in their current incarnations, the new Talent System is flexible enough this way to make notable changes. Sweeping Strikes becoming baseline and Soul Swap redesign are two such examples."

Tell them to cut out all the extra crap, give you your 4090 and install Windows yourself if you want it and activate with HWID to save $100.//////So I think you need to get off your high horse, your build is nice overall but you obviously just wasted huge money on things you simply don’t need.

Meaning, when you feel that what you are doing has meaning for others in some way, e.g. helping the homeless, children or family, picking up trash on the beach, etc.//////The three categories differ in their intensity and in their sustainability (i.e., how long you stay happy doing it). It has been found that things from//////- category 1 make you happy almost exclusively for the duration in which they happen, and afterwards the ""happiness"" falls back to the ""normal state"". On the other hand, they have the potential to provide a very strong short-term boost to happiness, which is just not sustainable.//////- Things from category 3 are exactly the opposite. These increase the feeling of happiness only minimally, but virtually forever.//////- Category 2 lies in the middle.//////What does this mean? In your ""work"" you should definitely make sure that you experience happiness of category 2 and/or 3 there. For this, of course, you must first know what brings you into a flow state, and what has meaning for you. But if you can do that, work will make you incredibly happy and will never feel like ""work"".//////If you want to learn more about the categories of happiness, I recommend Seligman with his lectures on positive psychology. For an introduction, the Ted Talk is quite good. //////Oh well, again useless knowledge://////we (especially in Western European countries) just live like robots, //////""Robot"" comes from from Czech ""robota"" =""to work"" (not from Russian)."

None of those things are worth the massive resource risk and economic risk of invading a country. Also how would a ""worse government"" ever be in a position to successfully invade the US? Russia has a shitty corrupt government and they failed horribly in even a small country like Ukraine. China has a government that most chinese people actually think is pretty good, and their bank accounts would lead one to believe that they must be doing something right. However, China already figured it out- why invade America when the piggies with insatiable appetite for cheap shit will just consume themselves into eternal deficit spending. You are not enemies, you are consumers. Then, when they have all our money, they can just buy up American real estate and companies using good old capitalism! Hey, let the free market decide right?

There were 2 co-workers that were hired after me that were given computer logins and keys before I was. They both received them after 1-3 months of being employed. My supervisor directly told me that I would get everything I needed ""tomorrow"" or ""next week"" or ""before the year ends"" or ""X date"", but never actually followed through with any of that. My supervisor then specifically stated to my co-worker ""I won't give \[u/Apprehensive_Elk_241\] \[necessary items for job\] because \[u/Apprehensive_Elk_241\] has Autism"" after he noticed that I wasn't given anything. It wasn't until after that co-worker left that I was finally given what I needed, about 10 months after starting, because my supervisor got annoyed when I would constantly call or text him when I needed something.//////>If they're paying you for the time that you're waiting for someone to give you access to a locked room, I'm not sure I see a negative employment action.//////In regards to waiting around for my supervisor to open locked rooms or the locked building, I was not paid for that time. I was told that I was only being paid while actively working and not when I'm waiting.

On Thursday I had her meet with the guidance counselor and the principal to let them know what's going on. Earlier in the school year she was living with her sister and her sister wouldn't take her to school and 17f was close to truancy. When she came to stay with us, I made sure she had a car to be able to travel where she needs to go. She is making the car payments and insurance.  She really is doing so well and we joke around about teaching her how to ""adult"". Which we all agree, sometimes adulting sucks. 😄"
