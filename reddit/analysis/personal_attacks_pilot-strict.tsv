0.9430390419	after:politics	(0.00205, 0.0061]	https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ho9rhy/comment/fxhodqc	TL;DR: The rules are *really* lax, and only rarely stop the government from purchasing foreign-made goods. The definitions for "domestic" are super broad, and the President can waive almost all of them on a whim. Roughly one-third of the world is exempt from the penalties.//////The long version://////Domestic-preference provisions have been part of U.S. Code [since the 1940s](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title41/subtitle4/chapter83&edition=prelim). In general terms, it says the government must purchase "domestic end products" in lieu of "foreign end products," unless the price for the domestic goods is deemed unreasonable or domestic production cannot meet quality standards or satisfy demand. //////The first part of that relies on differentiating between "foreign end products" and "domestic end products." For legal purposes, "foreign end products" are items whose components are 50% mined, produced, or manufactured outside of the United States. If your widget costs $100 to make, $40 of which is from imported Chinese steel, it's still "domestic" if the other $60 of parts are American made.//////The second part relies on "unreasonable prices." To determine what is "unreasonable," the Federal Acquisition Regulations apply a six percent penalty to the price of foreign-sourced goods. If the government wants to buy a widget, they pretend the $100 Chinese version costs $106 when comparing it to the American version. If the American version costs $107, the government is allowed to source the Chinese version. //////There are tougher rules if the purchase is being made with funds appropriated for national security, weapons and ammunition, federal prisons, for the blind or severely disabled, or if the item is being purchased through a sole-source contract, but waivers can still be issued. //////The waiver is an important part, because the law *also* says the President can waive domestic-sourcing requirements and allow the government to purchase from "designated countries" with which the United States has a signed trade agreement. That list is in [FAR 52.225-5](https://www.acquisition.gov/content/52225-5-trade-agreements), and includes:  /////////>World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement member countries: Armenia, Aruba, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia,  Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,  Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan,  Korea (Republic of), Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg,  Malta, Moldova, Montenegro, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland,  Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden,  Switzerland, Taiwan, Ukraine, or United Kingdom).  ///>  ///>Free-Trade Agreement countries: Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican  Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Korea (Republic of), Mexico,  Morocco, Nicaragua, Oman, Panama, Peru, or Singapore   ///>  ///>Least-developed countries:  Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Burundi,  Cambodia, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Democratic Republic  of Congo, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia,  Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Kiribati, Laos, Lesotho, Liberia,  Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, Rwanda,  Samoa, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands,  Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tuvalu, Uganda,  Vanuatu, Yemen, or Zambia   ///>  ///>Caribbean Basin countries: Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bonaire, British  Virgin Islands, Curacao, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica,  Montserrat, Saba, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the  Grenadines, Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten, or Trinidad and Tobago //////So, yanno, *everyone*.

Because one must ask: where do you draw the line on what constitutes valid historical evidence? And when we take that framework to other arguments, things start to seriously creak. You could use similar arguments against gay marriage, mixed marriages, people choosing their own partners for reasons beyond filial piety and social advancement...

Is it a coincidence that the USA, the most capitalist country in the world, was where Apple, Google and Microsoft etc etc were created? The policies/laws of the country allow for such innovation and actually support competitive markets to create goods/services. As for China, they have actually used their labour market to their advantage and created economic zones. Mertiocracy and capitalism are like sisters.. how can you not see that? correct me if i'm wrong but as soon as the Soviets turned to privatization, their GDP plummeted (which was inevitable) and then quadrupled the next decade. Would you like to explain that? Capitalism is the established order of our century and centuries to come. Anyone who even questions its efficiency doesn't understand pragmatic economics.	x

Significant portions of their population were going to be non-voting, so the 3/5 Compromise was hatched, which favored those states in Congress and the EC. The slavery heavy states were also the ones who largely insisted on the EC approach to picking the President, as otherwise their smaller voting populations (due in large part to slavery) wouldn’t have as much power. There’s a reason Virginia was the California of its day in the EC, and it had a lot to do with the slave population.//////Also, at the time of the founding and creation of the EC, there were pretty much only coastal states.

It’s the way it was with Vietnam, they kept kicking it down to their successor rather than deal with it. Putin is more than happy to let America continue being bogged down in our longest running war, and as we have seen, is willing to kill American soldiers to keep the war hot.//////In Syria, Trump caved and essentially handed all our influence to the Russians, even destroying our alliance with the Kurds, who have been our trusted allies throughout several decades and wars. One less friend in the Middle East now, which leaves us with Israel (sort of) and the Saudis (who actually should be our enemies but aren’t for the sake of $$$). Now Russia and Saudis go at it over oil.//////In the end the Trump administration has allowed the Taliban to perpetuate their influence back to a level unseen for 15 years, because they actually have no rudder in the Middle East, they don’t want to be accused of being soft on terror but they don’t want dead soldiers on the news, so they just pussyfoot around like in North Korea and achieve nothing.

A concurrence means the justice agreed with the basic holding (the “yes or no” part) and their vote counts as being in the majority. But they generally disagree with how the majority legally got to their conclusion. For example, O’Connor concurred in Lawrence v Texas because while she agreed the statute banning sodomy was unconstitutional, she thought it was unconstitutional under the equal protection clause and not fundamental rights doctrine which the majority used.	x

The rules for a charter include that a student only needs to be a CA resident, not a resident of the district. As a result, the students were very diverse in culture, race and economic status.

Biden has a huge infrastructure plan. Starting immediately...day one. And one thing I’m liking is he combines climate change issue, jobs, and communities in the plan.

At first I applied for jobs in my field, then I applied for jobs that I had held prior, last I applied for jobs that were basic entry level.  I can still remember talking to the hotel HR person about the maid position, she would not hire me as I was "too qualified" and would just quit if I got a better offer.  I was so angry I retorted back, I think most people quit any job when they get a better offer.  I ended up earning 40K a year less in an entry level government job.  On the bright side once inside the system many other jobs open up and I rose up to almost my prior salary after 4 years, but still good f'ing luck getting hired in a recession.	x
