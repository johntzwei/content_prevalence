The only exception seems to be when the VP is more controversial than usual, such as Palin (who seems to have had a strong negative impact on McCain's chances).

My point still stands that there was not a single incident of a far right group killing people. In contrast you have an entire plethora of people working together in these protests to coverup murder and destroy evidence. The “guards” of CHAZ shot up a car full of teens, then proceeded to take anyones cellphone who was around to make sure there was less evidence of it.

How hard it was for him to get there is insane enough, but to stay there is even more impressive.//////Medicine has its own very small but very cut throat world. Generally your colleagues are very type A, driven, quite smart, and they also want what you have. There are a select few who become a recognized name in their field; in order to get there it takes years of earning the respect and admiration of your colleagues by both your clinical decisions and your politics. Medicine votes their leaders by word of mouth - the colleagues you impress have been working in your field since as long as youve been alive.  Once you get there, your young will eat you to climb the ladder if your not paying attention.  //////After you make discoveries, write papers, and carve out a niche you'll start to grow your name within your institution, then outside your institution, then across your speciality. The entire time a bigger pool of colleagues is evaluating you through the quality of your work. You have now become a giant of your specialty, when you make a guideline or a recommendation your entire field listens and changes how they practice based on you because your name is pristine. Once that's done you get to play with the big boys to compete for jobs like Dr. Fauci. A man who was good enough to make the groundbreaking discoveries he did and lead the strongest nation (at the time) against the HIV pandemic, and he did it across 6 presidents. //////I don't care what anybody says: if you think this man isn't calculated in everything he does, you are severely underestimating him.

(0.992, 0.999]	https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/hlck6s/comment/fwzt3xx	Did you miss something.  Not too much, I suppose.  Barr fired the US Attorney for the SDNY, Geoffrey Berman.  When the US Atty refused to go, saying only the president could fire him, Barr fired him again, saying Trump authorized him to do so.  Trump, predictably, denied he had anything to do with it when questioned by the press.  Before the US Atty agreed to clear out his desk, he forced Barr to agree that the USAO-SDNY would be run by the career Deputy US Atty Audrey Strauss as Acting US Atty instead of by Barr's own candidate.  So Barr ended up not having his own stooge running the SDNY a few weeks later when Epstein's procuress got arrested in New Hampshire.	z

I tell you that “Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want and you're not going to like it". I then approach your car (equivalent to summoning the dog). Any reasonable person would assume I'm going to key your car. If you disagree..... what else might I mean by that?
