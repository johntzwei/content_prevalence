First, I do believe it’s a public road with a gate. St. Louis, at least when I lived there, has a very segregated population and there are plenty of roads that were once public with gates on them. I wasn’t ever able to figure out if their road specifically is private vs public with a gate.//////Second, once you get elected you’re no longer a private person. If you don’t want to be in the public sphere, don’t run for office. It’s completely fair game to protest in front of a mayors home, especially when she’s doxxing citizens. If she hadn’t read off a ton of private citizen’s addresses on TV who she disagreed with, I might have a little more sympathy, but she deserves to have people show up at her door because that’s what she tried to do to black lives matters activists.\n",

It is a school that focused on the arts.  I had looked into the other charters in the area and chose this one because of that reason. As part of the district there was more accountability on every level. I found independent charters to be dependable in their longevity and funding. /////////What I liked most about it was that there were no restrictions on location. The rules for a charter include that a student only needs to be a CA resident, not a resident of the district. As a result, the students were very diverse in culture, race and economic status. Also, because it’s a choice school, they can put very strict behavior and attendance expectations in place. She started the 2nd year it was open and we moved away after 3 years there. It wasn’t perfect, but better than the regular public school she went to next. /////////I think it’s a good alternative for families that want a non traditional educational experience for their kids. Not everyone can afford private school. Plus, private schools aren’t required to have teachers with a higher education or credentials.

The definitions for \"domestic\" are super broad, and the President can waive almost all of them on a whim. Roughly one-third of the world is exempt from the penalties.//////The long version://////Domestic-preference provisions have been part of U.S. Code [since the 1940s](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title41/subtitle4/chapter83&edition=prelim). In general terms, it says the government must purchase \"domestic end products\" in lieu of \"foreign end products,\" unless the price for the domestic goods is deemed unreasonable or domestic production cannot meet quality standards or satisfy demand. //////The first part of that relies on differentiating between \"foreign end products\" and \"domestic end products.\" For legal purposes, \"foreign end products\" are items whose components are 50% mined, produced, or manufactured outside of the United States. If your widget costs $100 to make, $40 of which is from imported Chinese steel, it's still \"domestic\" if the other $60 of parts are American made.//////The second part relies on \"unreasonable prices.\" To determine what is \"unreasonable,\" the Federal Acquisition Regulations apply a six percent penalty to the price of foreign-sourced goods. If the government wants to buy a widget, they pretend the $100 Chinese version costs $106 when comparing it to the American version. If the American version costs $107, the government is allowed to source the Chinese version. //////There are tougher rules if the purchase is being made with funds appropriated for national security, weapons and ammunition, federal prisons, for the blind or severely disabled, or if the item is being purchased through a sole-source contract, but waivers can still be issued. //////The waiver is an important part, because the law *also* says the President can waive domestic-sourcing requirements and allow the government to purchase from \"designated countries\" with which the United States has a signed trade agreement. That list is in [FAR 52.225-5](https://www.acquisition.gov/content/52225-5-trade-agreements), and includes:  /////////>World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement member countries: Armenia, Aruba, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia,  Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany,  Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan,  Korea (Republic of), Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg,  Malta, Moldova, Montenegro, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland,  Portugal, Romania, Singapore, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden,  Switzerland, Taiwan, Ukraine, or United Kingdom).  ///>  ///>Free-Trade Agreement countries: Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican  Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Korea (Republic of), Mexico,  Morocco, Nicaragua, Oman, Panama, Peru, or Singapore   ///>  ///>Least-developed countries:  Afghanistan, Angola, Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Burundi,  Cambodia, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Democratic Republic  of Congo, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia,  Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Kiribati, Laos, Lesotho, Liberia,  Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nepal, Niger, Rwanda,  Samoa, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands,  Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tuvalu, Uganda,  Vanuatu, Yemen, or Zambia   ///>  ///>Caribbean Basin countries: Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bonaire, British  Virgin Islands, Curacao, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica,  Montserrat, Saba, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the  Grenadines, Sint Eustatius, Sint Maarten, or Trinidad and Tobago //////So, yanno, *everyone*.

Putin is more than happy to let America continue being bogged down in our longest running war, and as we have seen, is willing to kill American soldiers to keep the war hot.//////In Syria, Trump caved and essentially handed all our influence to the Russians, even destroying our alliance with the Kurds, who have been our trusted allies throughout several decades and wars. One less friend in the Middle East now, which leaves us with Israel (sort of) and the Saudis (who actually should be our enemies but aren’t for the sake of $$$). Now Russia and Saudis go at it over oil.//////In the end the Trump administration has allowed the Taliban to perpetuate their influence back to a level unseen for 15 years, because they actually have no rudder in the Middle East, they don’t want to be accused of being soft on terror but they don’t want dead soldiers on the news, so they just pussyfoot around like in North Korea and achieve nothing.
