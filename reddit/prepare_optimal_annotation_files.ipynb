That's something that the progressives had issues with (Bernie with his massively youthful campaign and Warren with her middle-aged professional campaign both had low favorability among older voters). He's winning independents by gigantic margins. The last moderate alternatives had race/policing issues in their closet (Buttigieg firing the black police chief of South Bend; Klobuchar not prosecuting police brutality; Bloomberg with stop-and-frisk), which would've been a huge landmine for them in the current environment among black and brown voters where Biden has huge margins. I don't think they'd go Trump, but this is a three-way race between Biden, Trump and the couch. You need maximum participation among populations you're winning by 40+ points.//////I think any other Democrat would still be leading. There'd be a lot more undecideds (especially among independents) and third-party (especially among Republicans), but Biden's general inoffensiveness makes him a viable alternative for everyone. //////That's a double edged sword: I think he'll have a larger margin of victory because independents and moderate Republicans will show up for him, but his coattails will be smaller for the same reason. Reluctant moderate Republicans will go to the polls to vote for Biden as a viable alternative in a way that they wouldn't for Sanders or Klobuchar or Bloomberg and, while they're at the polls, they'll convince themselves that Susan Collins or Cory Gardner isn't like Trump and split the ticket.\n",

We need at least one person in the room during the day because there are certain things that can only be done on location, but because everyone else is working from home the rule is you need to wear a mask from the employee entrance to the door to our room (less than 200 ft) but once you're inside you don't need to anymore since you're the only one in there.//////Well, a couple of weeks ago when they started the \"mandatory mask\" policy the guy that had volunteered to be the one in the building for the last three months (so others could work from home, which we all preferred) threw a bit fit about having to wear a mask for those ~200 ft.//////He ended up being called into HR, where they explained to him that the mask was required and that our state has at-will employment, so if they wanted to they could fire him for not wearing the mask.  His response was \"I understand that and if that's the route you choose to go I will accept those consequences, but I will not wear a mask at work.\"//////He would rather get *fired* than wear a mask for ~200 ft in the morning and another ~200 ft in the evening.
